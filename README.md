    This project, though simple, helped me to understand the basics of DOM Manipulation.
    I was redirected to an MDN WebDocs page from The Odin Project. The page is meant to 
    shed light on DOM manipulation and this project sits at the bottom of the page with 
    hints on how to go at it. I didn't read the hints. I conditioned my mind to think the 
    picture of the end result is the only thing provided.

    I put my pen to paper to write out the little details that'll sum up to form this
    program. It took me a couple of hours to figure it out but the satisfaction at the
    end is unmatched. I'm happy I could develop this from a picture example. 

    What's left? I want the program to display a message when nothing is inputed in the 
    provided area. I've attemped this using a conditional statement, but the message either 
    remains after doing the right thing and the item gets added below or the item isn't 
    added while the message remains. 

    Overall, I'm glad I figured out how to make the delete button remove the item that 
    precedes it.
